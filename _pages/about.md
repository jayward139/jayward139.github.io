## Hello and Welcome to my Website!

I am thrilled to have you visit my academic website, a space dedicated to exploring my interest for political science, agnotology & epistemology, public health, and more. 

I am a political science researcher currently attending [University of California, Davis](https://ps.ucdavis.edu/) as a PhD graduate student. I graduated from [California State University, Fullerton](https://www.fullerton.edu/) first in 2020 with a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology with a minor in Political Science then in 2023 with a [Master of Arts in Political Science](https://hss.fullerton.edu/paj/PoliticalScience/ps_faq.aspx). I have also worked in managed healthcare and finance at startups. Most recently, I was Senior Corporate Development Analyst at [Excelera Health](https://excelerahealth.com/). I led the MAPD Eligibility Dept and Prescription Drug Reconciliation Program and served on the Social Analysis & Minority Health Team to develop a Medicare-tailored SDOH and Health Equity program and cost-controlled CRCCP. 

I focus my studies on political agnotology (the study of ignorance) and its many-fold applications from theory to praxis. My thesis examined agnotology in the context of Platonian and Machiavellian philosophy, Arendtian Phenomenology, Loneliness, Public Health, Business, the Nixon Presidency, and Nuclear Epistemology. I also invest myself in political psychology, misinformation, technology politics, health politics and policy, Post-9/11 US Grand Strategy, and Russian Revanchism. 

Hereâ€™s my [CV](https://jayward139.github.io/cv/) to get the full panopticon of my academic and professional experience.
