## Hello & Welcome!

I am thrilled to have you visit my academic website, a space dedicated to exploring my interest for political science, agnotology & epistemology, public health, and more. 

I am a **political science researcher** currently attending [University of California, Davis](https://ps.ucdavis.edu/) as a PhD graduate student. I graduated from [California State University, Fullerton](https://www.fullerton.edu/) first in 2020 with a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology with a minor in Political Science then in 2023 with a [Master of Arts in Political Science](https://hss.fullerton.edu/paj/PoliticalScience/ps_faq.aspx). I have also worked in managed healthcare and finance at startups. Most recently, I was the **Senior Corporate Development Analyst** at [Excelera Health](https://excelerahealth.com/). I led the MAPD Eligibility Dept and Prescription Drug Reconciliation Program and served on the Social Analysis & Minority Health Team to develop a Medicare-tailored SDOH data plan, an ACO REACH Health Equity program, and a cost-controlled CRCCP for a HEDIS/STARS COL measure strategy. 

I currently focus my studies on **political agnotology** (the study of ignorance) and its many-fold applications from theory to praxis. My master's thesis examined agnotology in the context of **Platonian and Machiavellian philosophy, Arendtian theory, Loneliness, Public Health, Business, the Nixon Presidency, and Nuclear Epistemology**. I also invest myself in political psychology, misinformation, technology politics, health politics and policy, Post-9/11 US Grand Strategy, and Russian Revanchism. 

I am currently an **[American Political Science Association Diversity Fellow](https://news.fullerton.edu/spotlight/titan-alumni-selected-for-american-political-science-associations-diversity-fellowship-program/)** for the 2023 - 2024 cohort and have been awarded the **UC Davis Provost’s Fellowship in the Arts, Humanities and Social Sciences** as an incoming first-year PhD student. Throughout my PhD program, I will be designated a **[CSU Chancellor's Doctoral Incentive Program (CDIP) Fellow](https://www.calstate.edu/csu-system/faculty-staff/cdip/)** and work with a mentor within the CSU system to enhance my scholarship. I have also been awarded fellowships within CSU Fullerton's **[Elevar and Grad Equity Scholars](https://www.fullerton.edu/graduate/about/elevar-equity-scholars/index.php)** and **[Pa'lante Fellowship](https://www.instagram.com/p/CspHvxWviiV/)** and was the 2022-2023 **Outstanding MA Student in Political Science** in the PAJ Division. 

Here’s my [CV](https://jayward139.github.io/cv/) to get the full scope of my academic and professional experience.
