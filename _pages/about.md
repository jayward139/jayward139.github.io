## Hello & Welcome!

I am a third-year Ph.D. student in Political Science at the **[University of California, Davis](https://ps.ucdavis.edu/)**, specializing in political agnotology (the production and politics of ignorance), digital political communication, and identity-based representation. My current research investigates how marginalized candidates—particularly Black women—strategically adjust ideological messaging across electoral stages using computational text analysis, regression discontinuity design (RDD), and AI-assisted models. I also explore AI-generated political messaging, health policy and economics, and misinformation’s role in shaping democratic participation and political affect.

I completed both my **B.A. in Psychology (minor in Political Science, 2020)** and **M.A. in Political Science (2023)** at **[California State University, Fullerton](https://www.fullerton.edu/humanities-social-sciences/politics-administration-justice/)**. Before academia, I worked in managed healthcare and startup finance, most recently as a Senior Corporate Development Analyst at Excelera Health, where I led Medicare Advantage enrollment operations, cost control for a medical group and high-complexity lab, prescription drug data reconciliation program, and health equity analytics focused on social determinants of health.
