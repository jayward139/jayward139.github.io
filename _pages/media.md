My good friend and peer Benjamin Soto and I made front page news in California State University, Fullerton's March 2023 Titan Spotlight. The **[American Political Science Association Diversity Fellowship](https://politicalsciencenow.com/meet-the-2023-2024-apsa-diversity-fellowship-program-fall-recipients/)** has only been awarded to 3 Titans in the program's 54-year history.

“I feel a lot of pride in representing CSUF on this scale,” said Ward, who is currently a second-year master’s student at CSUF. “The fact that I wouldn’t even have this opportunity without the support of the (Politics, Administration and Justice) division makes this all the more gratifying. It shows the commitment faculty have to their students and the return on investment CSUF and Titans get out of this relationship.”

I worked with **Associate Porfessor [Dr. Scott Spitzer](https://hss.fullerton.edu/paj/contact_us/faculty/s_spitzer.aspx)** to put on this event at CSU Fullerton just before the 2022 Midterms. 

“All Politics Is Local” event was co-sponsored and hosted by Pi Sigma Alpha – Epsilon-Eta. The Speaker series event invited Professor Raphael Sonnenshein, Director of the Pat Brown Center of California Politics at CSU Los Angeles, and Professor Jodi Balma, Department of Political Science at Fullerton College to talk about Orange County and Los Angeles County politics heading into the 2022 Midterm Elections. Pi Sigma Alpha collaborated with Professor Dr. Scott Spitzer plan the event to educate students on the lesser known state and local-level races and ballot measures while boosting youth voter turnout. The event was hosted by Pi Sigma Alpha Secretary-Treasurer Jalen Ward and panels were moderated by Professor of Political Science Stephen Stambough. The event was held 7:00 - 8:30 P.M. in the Titan (CSUF) Student Union Portola Pavilion.

As Secretary-Treasurer, I led the planning committee for the annual banquet for Pi Sigma Alpha - Epsilon-Eta Chapter.  

Pi Sigma Alpha’s Annual Banquet and Induction Ceremony took place April 29th at the Fullerton Arboretum’s Bacon Pavilion. The banquet recognized the events and accomplishments of the Pi Sigma Alpha and induct new members for the 23-24 academic year. Epsilon Eta’s Alumnae of the Year attended the event and gave keynote speeches to inductions members. The two alumnae were Eliza Ramirez-Gambon who is the Deputy Chief of Staff for Congressman Josh Gottheimer and Claudia Keller who is CEO at Second Harvest Food Bank of Orange. We also celebrated the significant commitments and contributions made by retiring faculty and **Chapter Advisor [Dr. Valerie O'Regan](https://hss.fullerton.edu/paj/contact_us/faculty/v_oregan.aspx)** with an intimate ceremony made possible by Pi Sigma Alpha alumni going back 12 years in the chapter’s history. 

This banquet was meant to honor the accomplishments of the Pi Sigma Alpha Epsilon Eta chapter while cherishing the local community the chapter has developed and invigorate young scholars to engage in future events. Two Alumnae of the Year were praised for their excellence and both gave inspirational speeches of their unique experiences after graduation. We also celebrated the significant commitments and contributions made by outgoing longtime Chapter Advisor Dr. Valerie O'Regan with speeches given by the **CSUF President [Fram Virjee](https://president.fullerton.edu/bio/index.aspx)**, **Political Science Dept Chair [Dr. Matthew Jarvis](http://hss.fullerton.edu/paj/contact_us/Faculty/m_jarvis.aspx)**, and **Alumna of the Year Eliza Ramirez-Gamboa**. The event honored Pi Sigma Alpha awardees for Outstanding Undergraduate and Graduate Student, Best DC Scholar, Spirit of Public Service Award, and Best Research Paper. We sought for this initiation ceremony and banquet to be an affordable and accessible opportunity for current and graduated members of the chapter to expand and strengthen the chapter’s alumni community by facilitating and enriching the value of cross-generational scholarship members can enjoy.
