## Teaching Overview

My teaching interests include political behavior, race and representation, political communication, misinformation and agnotology, and CSS. As a political scientist trained in both quantitative research and applied pedagogy, I aim to help students develop analytical skills while remaining attentive to questions of power, identity, and political knowledge.

I emphasize active learning, accessibility in instruction, media literacy, and connecting course material to lived political experiences. I will be teaching advocacy training classes to graduate students at UC Davis as the Legislative Affairs Director. My pedagogical approach is grounded in civic empowerment and critical inquiry.

## Pedagogical Commitments

My teaching philosophy centers on three core commitments:

1. **Critical Knowledge Formation** – Encouraging students not only to acquire information, but to examine how political “knowledge” is produced, manipulated, and contested.
2. **Applied Learning and Democratic Engagement** – Integrating contemporary political phenomena such as elections, misinformation, media ecosystems, and representation debates.
3. **Inclusive and Accessible Pedagogy** – Creating space for students from diverse academic and social backgrounds to engage, question, and connect theory to identity and lived experience.
